# ML
Machine Learning Projects completed for a class.

## RegressionModels
Testing out various regression models to determine their performance on predicting housing costs in Boston

## GradientDescent
Created custom implementations of Gradient Descent and the Normal Equation and compared with existing models, to predict medical costs

## kmeansClustering
Implemented the k-means clustering algorithm and applied it to California housing data to try to understand the California housing crisis

## SVM
Implemented the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm and applied it to the classis 'Moon' data set

## ANN
Designed a simple artificial neural network with existing frameworks, and created a custom neural network implementation. Compared the two with tuning 
on the classic 'XOR' dataset

##ImageClassificationNeuralNet
Designed the layers of a deep learning neural net and compared it to a pretrained model on their ability to classify images of iconic UVA buildings
